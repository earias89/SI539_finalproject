    <p>I am currently using population representative data to measure the change in proportion of voluntarily childless people over time and

        <h2> Evaluating the Accessibility and Usability of the Michigan Safer Opioid Prescribing Toolkit  </h2>
         <p>School of Nursing and the Injury Prevention Center at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</p>
         <p>A combination of UX Research methods were employed to (1) measure the social demographics most strongly 
            associated with toolkit use and common uses; (2) identify user goals, 
            and the extent this resource fulfills these goals; and (3) whether users of the 
            toolkit consider this a “one-stop-shop” resource. User attitudes about the 
            usability and accessibility were additionally measured.
